\chapter{Road Map}\label{chapter:road map}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction
\begin{enumerate}
	\item GRS - multiple numerical packages to solve complex multiphysics task
	\item Idea of NuT: an universal mathematician 
	\item NuT Architecture (client server)
	\item NuT is a wrapper of PetSc
	\item Typical numerical problem: Navier Stokes equation (time integration)
	\item Newton's method, Jacobian, Coloring
\end{enumerate}

\item Tasks: Double Buffer
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test new approach (without blocking to be sure that we don't introduce additional overheads(show proof with PAPI counters. Show that it fails))
	\item Test a modified approach (implicitly giving buffers to the user). Show improvements for small messages
	\item Switch to non-blocking and show the effect
	\item Choose appropriate size strategy
	\item Choose between sending 3 arrays or one derived data type
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
