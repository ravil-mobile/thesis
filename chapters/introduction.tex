% what is nuclear energy and why it is attractive?
Nowadays, nuclear energy is one of the main sources of electricity. It comes from splitting atoms in a reactor which, as a result, heats water up to the point where it is converted into pressurized steam. In its turn, the steam rotates turbines which, finally, produce electricity. According to the recent estimations, thermal efficiency of modern nuclear power plants lies in the range of 35-45\% which is comparable to conventional fossil fueled power plants \cite{intro:efficiency-of-nuclear-power-plants}. In spite of considerable initial investment,  nuclear power plants have low operating costs and long service life which make them particularly cost effective.\\


% Advantages
In recent years, nuclear power plants have become attractive means of power generation because of relatively low emission of carbon dioxide. As a result, a level of the green house gase emissions to the atmosphere and thus the contribution of nuclear power plants to global warming are relatively small \cite{intro:pros-and-cons-of-nuclear-power}.\\


% Example of nuclear energy utilization in the EU
Today, nuclear power plants generate almost 30\% of the electricity produced in the European Union (EU). There are almost 130 nuclear reactors in operation in 14 EU countries, namely: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom \cite{intro:eu-nuclear-industry-general}.\\


% danger of nuclear power
% Disadvantages: Accidents Can Happen
% idea: requirements to perform hundreds of experiments and foresee all possible outcomes.
The main problem assosiated with nuclear power is radioactive waste which is extremely dangerous for people and environment and has to be carefully looked after for several thousand years after utilization. Any accident in a plant can lead to grave consequences at a scale similar to Chernobyl disaster. For this reason, nuclear safety is one of the most important topics in this area. It demands a huge amount of testing and analysis to be performed before and during operation of a nuclear power plant in order to predict any possiblity of unwanted outcomes and devise preventive measures against such accidents. The topic has become even more prominent after 2011 Fukushima accident. In response to the disaster, numerous stress tests were conducted to measure the ability of the EU nuclear industry to withstand any kind of natural disaster \cite{intro:eu-nuclear-industry-general}.\\



% 1. \acrshort{grs}: general info and the goal
% 2. Simulation tools
Since 1977, Gesellschaft f√ºr Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (\acrshort{grs}) has been the main German scientific research institute in the field of nuclear safety and radioactive waste management \cite{grs:grs-general-info}. Today, the organization carries out advanced research and analysis in the field of reactor safety, radioactive waste management as well as radiation and environmental protection \cite{grs:grs-general-info}. Due to the inability to create various nuclear accident test scenarios, which by their very nature could be catastrophic, \acrshort{grs} develops and provides numerous simulation software products to cope with this problem. A short description of the main software packages developed by \acrshort{grs} is provided in table \ref{table:introduction-grs-software}.\\

%Due to a huge amount of testing, various types of possible accidents and disability to conduct natural experiments, \acrshort{grs} provides and develops numerous simulation software products to cope with this problem. Table \ref{table:introduction-grs-software} represents the main software packages that have been developed by \acrshort{grs} and their short description.\\
