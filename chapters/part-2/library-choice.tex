\section{Choice of Multifrontal Library}
\label{subseq:library-choice}
% talk about relative pivoting in case of multifrontal method
% which dense operations we use [unnecessary inria report]




% Give me the most popular sparce direct methods and compare them (goal: show that MUMPS it the most suitable package)


% to conclusion
There exist different implementations of multifrontal method on the market. Some implementations are open-source libraries (MUMPS, SuperLU, PaStiX, PSPASES, UMFPACK) and some of them are commercial packages (WSMP, PARDISO, etc.).
Some libraries can only handle Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices (PSPASES), some can run only sequentially (UMFPACK).\\

We can see from the primary documentations and literature review that MUMPS, PaStiX and SuperLU are open-source libraries and they can run on distributed environments in parallel. Both PaStiX and SuperLU are supernodal version of multifrontal method, whereas, MUMPS is the standard (classical) multifrontal implementation. [] showed in [] that MUMPS outperformed SuperLU \\
