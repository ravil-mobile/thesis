\section{Future work}
\label{subseq:part-2-future-work}

\begin{itemize}

	\item enhance the GRS matrix set to include more cases. Creation of database or collection
	
	\item create automatic testing environment. Since solvers to test solver updates

	\item Optimization engine for preconditioner parameter search.
	% hyperopt, SNOWPAC, Spearmint
	% problems: timeout should be move to the C code in order to estimate error reduction. It can help to determine quality of the preconditioner

	
	\item invasive computing (resource-aware programming)
	% it can help to find an optimal amout of PEs for a running problem
		
	
\end{itemize}
