% hybryd approach
% show motivation to use sparce direct methods: show a plot whith MUMPS and 100 interation of GMRES
% show all phases

We have observed all the method available and we can see that non of them can fulfill all our requirements at once, namely:

\begin{itemize}
	\item robustness
	\item numerical stability
	\item parallel efficiency
	\item open source licenses
\end{itemize}

The analysis from sections \ref{} and \ref{} shows that iterative methods scale much better in contrast to direct sparse ones. However, we cannot use them without preconditioning. Table \ref{} shows condition numbers for our GRS matrix set. It 

% tune preconditioners and then do comparison
