Next two subsections, i.e  \ref{subseq:part-2-iterative-solvers-theory} and \ref{subseq:part-2-direct-sparse-solvers-theory}, are organized as follows. The first part of each subsection contains a concise theory overview of a linear solver type. The second parts provide discussions of the main sources and means of parallelization of both iterative and direct sparse methods. The last part of each subsection focuses on issues related to numerical solution accuracy of a particular method type.\\
