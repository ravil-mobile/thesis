\section{Direct sparse methods}
\label{subseq:sparse methods}
% it can be seen that it's easy to apply, however, it is not the case

% problems with a good preconditioner

% show motivation to use sparce direct methods: show a plot whith MUMPS and 100 interation of GMRES

% Give me the most popular sparce direct methods and compare them (goal: show that MUMPS it the most suitable package)

% Introduction to Multifrontal method: describe all three phases

% Parallelism for Multifrontal method: put stress on importance of elimination tree

% where and how we can exploid multi-threding

% show a result where multithreding works

% Choice of blas labraries

% additional speed up can be achieved by using faster hardware or better algorithm for time integration
