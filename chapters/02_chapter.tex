\section{Choice of Multifrontal Library}
\label{subseq:multifrontal method}



\section{Overview of MUMPS Library}
\label{subseq:multifrontal-method}
% where and how we can exploid multi-threding
% show a result where multithreding works
% talk about relative pivoting in case of multifrontal method
% which dense operations we use [unnecessary inria report]

% Introduction to Multifrontal method: describe all three phases




\section{Choice of BLAS Library}
\label{subseq:blas-comparison}



\section{MPI-OpenMP Tuning of MUMPS Library}
\label{subseq:mpi-openmp}


\section{Conclusions}
\label{subseq:conclusions}


% hybrid: we thought it was a hard-ware specific problem, but it turned out it was algoritymic problem!

% additional speed up can be achieved by using faster hardware or better algorithm for time integration
