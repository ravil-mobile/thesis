%that could measure individual steps of numerical factorization for external packages. During the test we gradually increased the process count and measured the following PETSc parameters: 


%\begin{itemize}

%	\item MatLUFactorSym - time spent on symbolic factorization only (analysis phase)
	
%	\item MatLUFactorNum - time spent on numerical factorization only
	
%	\item PCSetUP - total time spent on $LU$ decomposition including all steps and overheads 
	
%	\item PCApply - time spent on forward and backward substitutions
%\end{itemize}





\section{Choice of BLAS Library}
\label{subseq:blas-comparison}
% Choice of blas labraries


% Typically, BLAS 3 routines (TRSM, GEMM) will be used during the factorization




% where and how we can exploid multi-threding
% show a result where multithreding works
% which dense operations we use [unnecessary inria report]

\section{Conclusions}

% hybrid: we thought it was a hard-ware specific problem, but it turned out it was algoritymic problem!

% additional speed up can be achieved by using faster hardware or better algorithm for time integration
