% Introduction to Multifrontal method: describe all three phases



% show motivation to use sparce direct methods: show a plot whith MUMPS and 100 interation of GMRES



% Parallelism for Multifrontal method: put stress on importance of elimination tree

% where and how we can exploid multi-threding

% show a result where multithreding works

% hybrid: we thought it was a hard-ware specific problem, but it turned out it was algoritymic problem!

% additional speed up can be achieved by using faster hardware or better algorithm for time integration
