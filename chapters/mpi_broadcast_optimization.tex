The implementations of the broadcast operation in MPICH [3] and Open MPI [4] are typically based on linear, binary,
binomial and pipelined algorithms [5]. The linear algorithms are not good for large numbers of processes, the binary and
binomial algorithms are not efficient for large data sizes. On the other hand, pipelined algorithms are more efficient for larger
numbers of processes and data sizes. Other widely used broadcast algorithms are scatter-ring-allgather and scatterrecursive-doubling-allgather
[6], which have been implemented in MPICH
