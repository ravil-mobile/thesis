\todo{reformulate the statement}
Parallel linear equation solvers are one of the most important components determining the scalability and efficiency of many supercomputing applications.\\

In many HPC applications, the optimized single-node performance is one of the most crucial building blocks for the optimization of probabilistic analysis or hybrid MPIOpenMP implementation.
