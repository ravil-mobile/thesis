\chapter{\abstractname}




Sparse linear systems of equations results from application of linear implicit methods for time integration of rather stiff systems of ODEs. The optimal selection and configuration of a parallel linear solver can sufficiently accelerate the time integration process and, therefore, decrease execution time of thermo-hydraulic simulations. An intelligent application of non-blocking MPI communications in some parts of the existing thermo-hydraulic simulation code, ATHLET, can additionally solve issues of inefficient data transfer preserving the current software design and implementation without drastic changes in the source code.\\




\todo{reformulate the statement}
Parallel linear equation solvers are one of the most important components determining the scalability and efficiency of many supercomputing applications.\\

In many HPC applications, the optimized single-node performance is one of the most crucial building blocks for the optimization of probabilistic analysis or hybrid MPIOpenMP implementation.
