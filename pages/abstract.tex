\textit{An application of linearly implicit methods for time integration of stiff systems of ODEs  results in solving sparse systems of linear equations. The optimal selection and configuration of a parallel linear solver can sufficiently accelerate the time integration process and, therefore, reduce execution time of such simulations.}\\



\textit{A comparison of iterative and direct sparse solvers has shown that direct ones are the most suitable because of their natural stability with respect to ill-conditioned linear systems that can occur during numerical time integration. Testing of different direct sparse solvers applied to systems generated by ATHLET software has revealed that MUMPS, an implementation of a multi-frontal method, performs better than the others in terms of the overall parallel execution time.}\\


\textit{In this study, we have mainly focused on configurations of MUMPS with the aim of improving parallel performance of the solver for thermo-hydraulic computations within a single node of GRS compute-cluster. We have investigated influences of  different fill reducing reordering algorithms, MPI process pining, configurations of MUMPS with different BLAS library implementations and MPI/OpenMP hybrid computing strategies on parallel performance of the solver.}\\


\textit{Additionally, we have shown that an intelligent application of non-blocking MPI communications in some parts of the existing thermo-hydraulic simulation code, ATHLET, can additionally solve issues of inefficient data transfer preserving the current software design and implementation without drastic changes in the source code.}\\
